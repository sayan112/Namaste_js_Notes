// console.log(a);
// var a;
// console.log(a);


// 1. Undefined is like a placeholder till a variable is not assigned a value.
// 2. undefined !== not defined
// 3. JS- weakly typed language since it doesn't depend on data type declarations.


// *** what is not defined  :) 
//  Not defined: In JavaScript, it is one of the reference errors that JavaScript will throw when someone accesses the variable which is not inside the memory heap.

// JS- weakly typed language why ?  see now :)

 console.log(a);

 var a = 0;
  console.log(a);
  var a =" sayan maitra " ; 
   console.log(a);


   // we can assign "a"  with numerical value , after that we dont have to change the data type , we can directly assign it a string value , it doesn't matter :) so thats why its weakly or loosely types language
